# Parking Lot Program

Hello! This is my very first try to build a program using Kotlin Language which is developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

## About
Cities are becoming smarter to meet our needs, and parking spaces are an essential part of urban design. As a developer, you can help improve them. In this project, you will create a parking lot management program that keeps track of vacant spots and parked vehicles.

### Kotlin Features Used for Submission for #30DaysOfKotlinChallenge
```These are:
1. String Templates
2. Data class
3. Inheritance
```

More feature are use of while, when and @loop with contine@loop and break@loop.<br />
Whole project runs on function calls, and we have used Scanner class. 

### Instructions to run the program
```
1. Fork the repositoy and then clone a local copy.
2. Open in the project in the IntelliJ IDEA
3. Build the Project (Ctrl + F9) 
4. Run the Project (Shift + F10)
```
